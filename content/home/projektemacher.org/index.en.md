My "proving ground" to try out ideas and to present some of my [collections](/en/collections/) since the corona pandemic is [Projektemacher.org](https://projektemacher.org), there are various (sub-) projects linked. To a certain extent, these are old blog projects that were previously hosted on [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com). The newer part revolves around the presentation of various collections. These in turn can be divided into the following groups:
 * Resources for other pages (such as [Schriftmuster](https://schriftmuster.projektemacher.org/) and [Vorsatzpapier](https://vorsatzpapier.projektemacher.org/))
 * Interesting content (such as [Blaufusstölpel](https://blaufusstölpel.de/) and [Kinderbücher](https://kinderbücher.projektemacher.org/))
 * Experiments on presentation (such as [Kleiderbügel](https://Kleiderbügel.blaufusstölpel.de/) and [VintageReality](https://vintagereality.projektemacher.org/)), also have a look at the [showcase](#showcase) below.

Continuous improvements to the existing blogs as well as some new ones are planed for the future...
