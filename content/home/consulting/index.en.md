If you need advice on digitizing and presenting your collection online, I will be happy to offer my help and experience.
Regardless whether it is a small collection, a very specific topic (e.g. to present an exhibition) or an entire library.
This offer is aimed at all institutions of cultural heritage and is not limited to printed matter, even if my professional focus is in the field of digital libraries.
