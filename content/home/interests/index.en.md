I'm interested in various aspects of everyday culture in the 20th century and how it can be transported digitally. To do this, I collect various artifacts and also like to try them out. I also present some of the results and collections online.

My aim is to use up-to-date (i.e. digital) presentation methods to support the immersion into the younger past, which has the most lasting effect on our everyday life today, the 20th century...

As my resources for my projects are limited, I also focus on resource-conserving and sustainable realisation. 

I am also interested in old media and media formats, which can be seen in the [collection focuses](https://christianmahnke.de/collections/#medien), as well as in practical projects such as [YAAPB](https://yaapb.projektemacher.org/), my photo blog or the older ["Diapräsentation"](https://diapraesentation.projektemacher.org/) ("slide presentation"). {{< link link="/tags/HybridMedia" class="blog inline" >}}Blog Beiträge{{< /link >}}
