The main focus of my collection is on different everyday culture related artifacts from the 20th century. Since this is a quite broad area, here is a list of more particular topics:

## Artifacts
* Optical devices and toys
* Consumer electronics
  * Tape recorders
  * Projectors
* Hangers
* Glasses
* Airplane cutlery
* Ceramic, glass and porcelain objects

## Books and printed matter
 (*mainly between 1890 and 1945*)
* Advisory literature (*especially with regard to transported role models*)
  * Letter-writer's guides
  * Entertainment
  * Health / Medicine
    * Personal hygiene
    * Sex education
    * Memory training
* Beautiful children's books
  * Scrap books
* Photo books (*especially in rotogravure printing*)
* Interior decoration
* Atlases and maps
* Advertising
* Commercial art
  * Typography
* Magazines
  * Entertainment
  * Fashion
  * Architecture
  * Technology

## Art
* Graphic arts and prints

## Media
* Tapes
* Films (*e.g. Super 8*)
* Slides
* 3D images / Viewmaster

My goal is not to cover any these topics even halfway complete, but to depict a (not necessarily representative) cross-section.
