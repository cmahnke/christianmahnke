The source materials of my [blogs](https://projektemacher.org/blogs/) as well as my printed materials can be used for your own work. Regardless of whether plan on doing a scientific work (master's theses, doctoral theses, other publications), try to realise some creative idea (fonts, photos, etc.), exhibitions or your own web project (such as a blog, etc.), please do not hesitate to contact me. And if you are interested in one topic and still lack the right project, I will be happy to help as well.
