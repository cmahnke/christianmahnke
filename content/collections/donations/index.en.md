Every now and then I also find things that may be of interest to archives, museums or widely known collectors. In such cases, I contact the institution that I think is the most suitable.

## Activist Donor

Similar to an ["Activist shareholder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder) I see myself as an activist donor, which means that it is not only important to me that an artifact or a medium is preserved, but also that access to it is possible by up to date (digital) means for the general public.
This is of course due to [my professional background](/about/#professional-interests) and is simply a necessity in preserving cultural heritage. If your institution is not able to do this, I would be happy to support you.

Therefore, I expect the institution to be prepared to meet the following of conditions:

<ul class="list-block">
    <li><div class="li-heading">Cataloging</div>
        <div class="li-body type-text">The object will be placed in your publicly and online accessible record system (catalogue, etc.) at short notice. The record can be retrieved at least via a persistent URL in HTML format. The catalog entry is not subject to any restrictions on subsequent re-use (e.g. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" title="CC0">CC0</a>). The provenance (i.e. the donor) part of the catalogue entry.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li><div class="li-heading">Digitisation</div></li>
        <div class="li-body type-text">The object is digitized and the resulting files (including raw data) are made available to me for presentation - the license should allow the widest possible reuse - ideally <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" title="CC0">CC0</a>.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li><div class="li-heading">Presentation in your online portal</div></li>
        <div class="li-body type-text">he digitized material is presented in the context of your other digitised objects, regardless of whether the presentation takes place directly in your institution or in a (library) network.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li><div class="li-heading">Publication in a supra-regional portal</div></li>
        <div class="li-body type-text">You upload or reference the digitised object including metadata into a research portal with at least a nationwide reach (for archive material, for example <a href="https://www.archivportal-d.de/" title="Archivportal D">Archivportal D</a>, for printed items the <a href="https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/" title="Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a>).
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

**The whole process should ideally take no longer than 12 months.**
