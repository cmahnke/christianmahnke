A graphic by the Spandau artist Fritz Neumann

<!--more-->

After Mr Schuth from the archive of the Spandau City History Museum provided me with the [key hint](/post/ric-unknownartist/) to Fritz Neumann, also known as [Ric](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/), it was time to give one of his works to a cultural institution in his hometown.
