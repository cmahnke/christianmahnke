"Open GLAM Data Evangelist" is a combination of ["Open Data"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data), ["GLAM" (abbreviation for "Galleries", "Libraries", "Archives" and "Museum")](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM) and ["Evangelist"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Evangelist) and thus rather a self-invented title. The definition could be: A person who promotes the free accessibility and reuse of cultural heritage data. He advises GLAM institutions on opening up their digital content and connects cultural sectors with the open data community. The aim is to open up cultural heritage for research, education and creative use.
