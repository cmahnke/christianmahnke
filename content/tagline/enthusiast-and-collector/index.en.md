The original self-designation. I can also be found under the latter in [museum-digital](https://www.museum-digital.de/)(https://term.museum-digital.de/md-de/persinst/322830).

It describes the original scope of my [websites](https://projektemacher.org/), but since the scope has grown considerably in the meantime, there are now several titles.

Examples of activities in this area are:

### Blog posts on the topic:
* [Donations](/en/tags/Donation/)
* [Unusual objects](/en/tags/Object/)

### Sonstige Seiten
* [Projektemacher: Pages and Blogs](https://projektemacher.org/en/blogs/)
