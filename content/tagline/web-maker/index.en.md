"Web maker" is a combination of "web" and "maker" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). The term refers to a person who conceives, designs and technically implements websites. In contrast to traditional web developers, the focus here is usually on providing comprehensive support for design, content and functionality. These individuals combine creative design with technical understanding to create innovative online presences in terms of both content and technology. This role is therefore also related to that of a creator.
