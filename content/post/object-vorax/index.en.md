I have once again found an interesting object...

<!--more-->

... and sometimes it's a good idea to buy something you don't even know what it is. Originally it reminded me of a [Dalek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) from [Dr Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who), but as I found it in the power tools section, it certainly wasn't a toy...

The device is a Vorax G4 drilling machine in a housing. The handle is recognisable in the side view. Devices from the series can be found, for example, in the [German Digital Library](https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/FGPLDSHCDBDEQLSLSC5PGIVCWP4SVZKD) (source TECHNOSEUM Landesmuseum für Technik und Arbeit in Mannheim, inventory number EVZ:2013/0685-001) or in the [German Plastics Museum](https://www.deutsches-kunststoff-museum.de/sammlung/virtuelles-museum/k-1993-00534/) (inventory number K-1993-00534).

The drills from this series were used as motors for many household appliances at the time, such as blenders.

The virtual museum has an [article on the manufacturing company Bresges & Co. G.m.b.H](https://www.virtuelles-museum.com/zeit/als-ein-vorax-nach-erkelenz-kam/), unfortunately there is contradictory information on when the company existed: from 1925 to 1945 or 1955. Always an indicator of the age of the appliance...

The [50s Museum Datteln](https://50erjahremuseumdatteln.de/) has also dedicated a video to the "Vielfachgerät" ("multiple appliance"):
