Who doesn't know them, the three blue towers of the University of Göttingen,...

<!--more-->

...probably almost nobody, because they were never built.


My new blog [Never Built Göttingen](https://never-built.goettingen.xyz/) shows a Göttingen that was never built. From the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, a lot of money flowed into the up-and-coming university town in the far east of Western Germany. The blog shows the boldest designs and planning stages for buildings that were later realised differently.

AI was used for the realisation, especially for image processing. The creation of the map material is described in the post "[Build vector map material with GitHub](/en/post/build-vector-tiles-on-github/)".
