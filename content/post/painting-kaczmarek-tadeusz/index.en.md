I have found a painting by [Tadeusz Kaczmarek](https://jbc.jelenia-gora.pl/dlibra/publication/45520/edition/41040/content) ([automatic translation](https://jbc-jelenia--gora-pl.translate.goog//Content/41040/kaczmarek.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp)) (1937-2006)...

...and because one wants to be on the beach in summer in the middle of winter, I bought it.

Tadeusz Kaczmarek was a Polish artist who worked as a painter, graphic artist and interior designer. He lived and worked mainly in the [Lower Silesian Voivodeship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Silesian_Voivodeship).

The painting shows the beach of [Boltenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltenhagen), Schleswig-Holstein on the Baltic Sea coast.

There is also a [blog](https://kaczmarek-art.blogspot.com/2021/01/kaczmarek-tadeusz-1937-2006-malarstwo.html) with some of his works. A very similar painting is also listed there.
