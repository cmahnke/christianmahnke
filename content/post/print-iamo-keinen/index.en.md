The picture comes from a series of books with motifs, so it is actually a book page, the stitching / binding is also still recognisable. The series contains birds and flowers of the four seasons ("Album of Bird-and-Flower Pictures", originally transliterated "Keinen Kacho Gafu"), the page above is part of the 3rd volume (Autumn).

The [page](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/image/1613213177) and the [entire work](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_HG-0-253-3) are available digitised in the British Museum (inventory no. HG,0.253.3),

This also makes it easy to date: The volume was published in 1892.
