I found a woodcut by [Eva Roemer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Roemer) (1889-1977)...
<!--more-->

The title is probably "Snow on the reeds (Lake Starnberg)" (German: "Schnee auf dem Schilf (Starnberger See)").

Since I have been working with Gerbrand Caspers for years, this article is another good opportunity to refer to his work on Eva Roemer:

* [The Linosaurus: Eva Roemer](https://gerrie-thefriendlyghost.blogspot.com/2011/07/eva-roemer.html)
* DAS HAUS DER FRAU: Eva Roemer](https://www.dashausderfrau.nl/roemer-eva.html) - here you can also find the print above.

Eva Roemer was also associated with Göttingen, further information on her can be found in [Göttinger Künstlerlexikon](https://univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-504-5/Appel_diss.pdf) by Thomas Appel.
