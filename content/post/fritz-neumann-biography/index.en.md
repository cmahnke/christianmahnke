After the identity of [Fritz Neumann and thus Ric could be clarified in October](https://christianmahnke.de/post/ric-unknownartist/), [Mark Strong from Meibohm Fine Arts](https://www.meibohmfinearts.com/) compiled, condensed and published on [AskArt](https://www.askart.com/artist/Fritz_Neumann/11057559/Fritz_Neumann.aspx) on the basis of the findings from [my blog](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/).

Without a paid membership, the full biography can be viewed every Friday, otherwise it is also available for free at [Meibohm Fine Arts](https://www.meibohmfinearts.com/artists/details/2873).

Many thanks to Mark for his work!
