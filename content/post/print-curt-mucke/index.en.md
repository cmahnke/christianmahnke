Curt Mücke was a painter and graphic artist from Sondershausen. His motifs often show night scenes, often in winter, like this one. He was a master student of [Max Klinger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Klinger).

The picture shows the Siedelhof in the Schloßgasse in Jena, the building housed a [branch of the Jena City Museum](https://www.stadtmuseum-jena.de/de/stadtmuseum/hausgeschichte/710396) from 1927 and was destroyed in the Second World War.
