You can now search this page...
<!--more-->

As there are now almost 100 posts, it was [time](/post/tag-pairs/) to be able to search the page.

In order to better utilise the full depth of information, especially the blog posts, entities, e.g. links to Wikipedia, are used to [enrich the index](/post/configure-pagefind). For example, synonyms can also be taken into account for the search. In addition, search queries can also be narrowed down to entities

As the page only consists of static HTML and JavaScript, the [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) software optimised for such scenarios is used. All search options can be found on the new [search page](/search/).
