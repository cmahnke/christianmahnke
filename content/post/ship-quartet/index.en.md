Something about unexpectedly contemporary games...
<!--more-->

As a child of the 80s and thus of the Cold War, you still know the effects of ‘war fitness’ on everyday life. It wasn't just when you had to wait for the convoy on the school bus that one of the things you did to pass the journey through half the community was play a game of quartets. Of course, in addition to civilian things like cars and aeroplanes, fire engines etc., there were always military variants: Tanks, fighter planes or warships.

## Up(date)cycling

From today's perspective, it is striking that only Western countries and the Soviet Union are represented with ships.

And I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the installation ["All the Submarines of the United States of America"](https://www.sartle.com/artwork/all-the-submarines-of-the-united-states-of-america-chris-burden), 1987 by [Chris Burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Burden).

As the cards are printed on paper that is too thick for a typewriter, they were processed using a [Famos](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famos_(company)) children's printer.
