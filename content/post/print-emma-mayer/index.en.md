As the name "Emma Mayer" (or "Meyer") is relatively common, it was not so easy to find an exact assignment here. There are also:

* [Emma Eleonore Meyer (1859-1921)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Eleonore_Meyer)
* [Emmy Meyer (1866-1940)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Meyer_(painter))

The artists are also often confused on the net or at auctions, here for example at [invaluable](https://www.invaluable.com/artist/meyer-emma-eleonore-5so5yxrsh5/sold-at-auction-prices/).

As is so often the case with such woodcuts, Gerbrand Caspers has already done a lot of detective work and found out the following information:

Emma Mayer studied in Munich and Hamburg. Around a dozen woodcuts in various styles are currently known. The motifs are flowers, as in this print, landscapes, cityscapes and religious subjects. As mentioned above, she is often confused, especially with Emma (Eleonore) Meyer (1859-1921), who taught at the Hamburg School of Arts and Crafts in 1913.

Gerbrand also created individual pages on the women artists mentioned:
* [DAS HAUS DER FRAU: Emma Mayer](https://www.dashausderfrau.nl/mayer-emma.html) - the illustrated print can also be found here.
* [DAS HAUS DER FRAU: Emmie Meyer](https://www.dashausderfrau.nl/meyer-emmie.html)
* [The Linosaurus: Emma Meyer (Mayer)](https://gerrie-thefriendlyghost.blogspot.com/2013/03/emma-meyer-mayer-danish-printmaker.html)
