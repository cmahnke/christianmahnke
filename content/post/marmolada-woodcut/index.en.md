...is "old news" by now: Neither when it comes to the effects that can be recognised in old works, nor as an object of art itself.

While the last approach had perhaps already reached its climax with ["Soylent Green "](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green), today I have the opportunity to point out the melting of the glaciers in the [Dolomites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomites).

I acquired this woodcut a few weeks ago and I couldn't find out anything about the monogram and thus the artist. Even the respected experts Gerbrand Caspers (curator of [Das Haus der Frau](https://www.dashausderfrau.nl/) and [The Linosaurus](https://gerrie-thefriendlyghost.blogspot.com/)) and [Wolfgang Barina](http://www.wolfgang-barina.de/kunst/) were unable to identify it. But Wolfgang was able to determine the motif, i.e. the mountain, many thanks for that!

# Perspective

{{< image-compare image1="img/print.jpg" caption1="Holzschnitt" image2="img/render.jpg" caption2="3D Bild aus HÃ¶henprofil" >}}

The picture shows the mountain [Marmolata](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmolata), which had a turbulent history, for example during the First World War, from the north, very probably from the vicinity of "falesia Col Rodella" near [Canazei](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canazei). An elevation profile converted into a 3D view (using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)) helped to determine the perspective more precisely. Minor inconsistencies certainly fall under artistic liberty. For comparison, here is a current all-round view from the specific position:

# The glacier

The retreat of the glacier in the centre of the picture is a dramatic contrast to the war. It seems so present here because it is the only part of the picture for which no colour has been used. Something that was represented by an omission is soon really gone:

This glacier, like most in the Alps, is affected by ["glacier retreat"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850). It is currently estimated that it will have disappeared by 2040 - in around 15 years!

As illustrations are more appealing than statistics, here is a comparison with a photo taken in August 2024:
