Elsa Hoppe was an artist from Göttingen, after whom a street in Göttingen is named. Further information about her can be found in the [Göttinger Künstlerlexikon (German)](https://univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-504-5/Appel_diss.pdf) by Thomas Appel.
Similar motifs are illustrated in the booklet ‘Elsa Hoppe Grüsse zum Jahreswechsel’ by Karlheinz Stalder, published in 1999 by Goltze, Göttingen, ISBN 3884528572.

Even if the signature is difficult to read, an enquiry with Simone Hübner of the [Städtisches Museum Göttingen](https://museum.goettingen.de/) confirmed that it's a print by Elsa Hoppe...
