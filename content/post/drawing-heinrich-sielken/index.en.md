Heinrich Sielken was an architect who was born in Hanover and worked in Bremen from 1920. In 1927 he published an article in the Deutsche Bauzeitung ([61. Jahrgang. 1927, Nr. 58, S. 481-485](https://delibra.bg.polsl.pl/Content/14217/P-388_1927_58.pdf)) about the Holy Trinity Church of St Sergius near Moscow. The drawings and the article were most likely created on the same journey.

Sielken later worked for [Paul Kossel & Cie. KG, Beton- und Eisenbetonbau-Unternehmung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kossel), which carried out the concrete work for the Wulsdorf residential water tower.
