I have acquired a linocut by [Hans Martin Erhardt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Martin_Erhardt) (1935-2015)...

Unfortunately, not much could be found out, but based on similar sheets from the net, this one can be roughly dated to the first half of the 70ies and that it could be an abstract landscape...
And I'm not even sure that it's a linocut, as the sheet seems too detailed, but his other similar works from the time are labelled as linocuts on the net.
