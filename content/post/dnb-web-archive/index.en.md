After attending a workshop of the [Infra Wiss Blogs](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/projekte/infra-wiss-blogs) project in Berlin in December, my blogs can now be found in the [Web Archive of the German National Library](https://www.dnb.de/DE/Professionell/Sammeln/Sammlung_Websites/sammlung_websites_node.html).

At the moment they can only be viewed from the DNB reading rooms, but I assume that this could change in the next few years for sites with the right licence.
