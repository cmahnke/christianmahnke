Erich Zimmer was an artist from Göttingen. Further information on him can be found in the [Göttinger Künstlerlexikon](https://univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-504-5/Appel_diss.pdf) by Thomas Appel. A woodcut with the title "Unicorn, human with musical instrument" is also listed there, albeit with the date of creation 1995.
As the sheet is inscribed with handwritten congratulations for the year 1981 by the artist, its creation can be dated to 1980.
