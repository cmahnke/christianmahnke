After the [Briefsteller blog](https://briefsteller.de/) had existed as a skeleton since the beginning of 2021, I used my summer holiday to bring the sample letter, which brought me to the topic ["letter writing guides"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_letter_writing_guides) in the first place, [online](https://briefsteller.de/post/der-haussekretaer/286/)...

The original idea was to present the letters as a podcast. The recording hardware (audio interface, more or less historical microphones) is ready, the only thing missing is time. The first entry was therefore a good opportunity to dig into AI-supported speech generation.

The whole thing is no longer rocket science, both the software and the models are freely available:
* The software used is [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
* Thorsten-Voice](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/) (variant "Emotional") by Thorsten MÃ¼ller is used as a voice model.

In the meantime, my collection of corresponding books has more than doubled in size, but unfortunately I still don't have the time to make them fully accessible...
