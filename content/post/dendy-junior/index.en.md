I found another interesting old console...
<!--more-->

... it's a [Dendy Junior II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendy), an unlicensed clone of a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

The family of Dendy consoles was distributed in Russia in the 1990s by the company Steepler. The consoles themselves were produced in Taiwan by TXC (producer of the [Micro Genius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Genius)). As the western consoles from Sega or Nintendo were not sold directly in post-Soviet Russia and the high price of the original consoles effectively prevented their import, these were a widespread substitute: between 1.5 and 6 million units were sold.

Released in the summer of 1993, the Junior is characterized by its compact design, comprising a grey, box-shaped unit with two permanently attached controllers. The unit uses standard Famicom plug-in modules which are inserted into a slot on the top of the console. The appearance is directly based on the original Famicom, i.e. the Japanese version of the NES, apart from the integrated cables of the gamepads that lead into the housing of the console.

There is also a short, informative YouTube video that explains the history of the console (in German).
