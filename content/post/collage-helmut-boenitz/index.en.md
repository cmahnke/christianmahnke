Helmut Bönitz (1914-1999) was an artist from Göttingen, which is why he can also be found in Thomas Appel's [Göttinger Künstlerlexikon](https://univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-504-5/Appel_diss.pdf).

The collage is dated 1974, I could not find it in the catalogues of the Göttinger Kunstmarkt or in the two volumes "Arbeiten von 1945 bis 1985" by him...
