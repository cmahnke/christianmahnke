An old mystery finally solved...

<!--more-->

Since the beginning of 2019 I have been running the blog ["Ric Unknown Artist"](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/), first on Tumblr, then on my own infrastructure. It's about revealing the identity of an artist who has signed his works with the pseudonym "Ric". Even though it seemed for a long time that this artist had been identified, it turned out in July that the attribution was wrong, even though the name was correct.

I then searched through some old Berlin address books and discovered that the correct artist had lived in Berlin Spandau / Haselhorst for about 50 years.

An enquiry at the archive of the Spandau City History Museum provided the solution, [more in the blog](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/de/post/fritz-neumann-spandauer-volksblatt-19-2-1972/).
