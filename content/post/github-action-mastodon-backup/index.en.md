Due to recent events...
<!-more-->

...even though I haven't posted anything on Mastodon for a long time, I wanted to publish my activities there again between Christmas and New Year.

Unfortunately, [openbiblio.social](https://openbiblio.social/home) was [down](https://bibcourse.eu/t/https-openbiblio-social-down/284/19). Even though I don't plan to do so at the moment, here's an example of how you can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to make a backup – just in case you ever want to move. In principle, you can also use it to create a static presentation for the site.

```yaml
