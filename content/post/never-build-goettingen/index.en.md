Who doesn't know them, the three blue towers of the University of Göttingen,...

<!--more-->

...probably almost nobody, because they were never built.


My new blog [Never Build Göttingen](https://never-build.goettingen.xyz/) shows a Göttingen that was never built. From the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, a lot of money flowed into the up-and-coming university town in the far east of Western Germany. The blog shows the boldest designs and planning stages for buildings that were later realised differently.
