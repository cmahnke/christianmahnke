I bought this framed graphic at a flea market years ago. It is signed "Nixdorf Computer AG" behind the passe-partout. Unfortunately, relatively little can be found out about it. An enquiry at the [Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum](https://www.hnf.de/home.html) did not yield any concrete information.

Therefore, here is the assessment of [Prof. Dr Frieder Nake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieder_Nake) from ["compArt | centre of excellence digital art"](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/):

{{< quote from="[Prof. Dr. Frieder Nake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieder_Nake)" >}}
I don't know this graphic and I have no immediate idea who it could be from. The clear reference to "Nixdorf" should be the start of the trail. It suggests that an employee there created the picture. Even if he did it on behalf of Nixdorf alone or if Nixdorf acquired it from an independent person, in the 1960s such images appeared as products made with digital computers. The mathematical-geometric organisations are usually quite simple, as is the case here. We are dealing with a mass of quite cleverly defined straight lines that start from and end at points along an ellipse. Only in the centre section above do these starting points lie slightly outside the ellipse and thus create a small, special tension.
