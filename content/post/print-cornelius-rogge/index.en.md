Cornelius Rogge was an etcher in the [artists' colony of Dötlingen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCnstlerkolonie_D%C3%B6tlingen) and from 1922 in [Worpswede](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worpswede), about 60 kilometres away. His motifs mainly depict the North German landscape and he was the brother of [Emy Rogge](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emy_Rogge). After working as an export merchant, the period of inflation led him to use his self-taught skills to earn a living as an artist.

The picture shows the entrance and windows of a house on a summer evening in Worpswede.

The website of the Dötlingen Foundation also has an article about [Cornelius Rogge](http://www.kuenstlerkolonie-doetlingen.de/cornelius-rogge.html).
