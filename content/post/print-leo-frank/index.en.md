The print can also be found in the [British Museum collection](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1980-U-1254), (illustration at the [Contemporary Art Society](https://contemporaryartsociety.org/objects/buzzard-mist-1904-1927)). Copies can be found online at various auction houses, the title could be "Birds of Prey in the Highlands" or "Buzzard in the Mist". On the [page of Wolfgang Barina](https://www.wolfgang-barina.de/kunst/sammlung/farbschnitte/frank-Leo-fhs-Bussarde.html) the title is only "Bussarde".
Leo Frank was a Viennese artist who also taught printing and drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.
