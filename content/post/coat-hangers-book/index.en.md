The first book based on one of my blogs is now complete...

Following the [revamp of the clothes hanger blog in autumn](/post/kleiderbuegel-2025/), a collection catalogue is now also available.

{{< pdf-preview pdf="kleiderbuegel-2025.pdf" download=true >}}

Hugo was used again for the implementation (https://gohugo.io/), and Vivliostyle was used for typesetting and PDF generation (https://vivliostyle.org/). It is the first project I have realised with CSS for printing. I have already described my experiences in the article [‘Papiertiger CSS for printing’](/post/paper-tiger-print-css/).

Even though the project is now complete, I stand by my assessment at the time: **CSS (and the ecosystem associated with printing) is not yet suitable for the smooth creation of printed books.**
