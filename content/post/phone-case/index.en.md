Today, once again, one of the rather rare non-digital projects: A cover for my new phone.
<!--more-->

The source material is a cheap, old book from [Antiquariats Pretzsch](https://antiquariat-pretzsch.de/) NÂ°1.

I glued the individual pages one by one, not all at once, so that the paper doesn't get too wavy due to the moisture of the glue and so that the pages still hold together when you cut out the centre part. Once all the sides have been glued together, you can simply cut out the inner part with a craft knife or carpet knife. If you don't take too much away, or cut it so that the opening is slightly wider at the bottom, you can make sure that the phone doesn't fall out so quickly.

To make the edges more stable, you should then cover the whole thing with thicker paper (e.g. a map or thicker wrapping paper). This can also conceal minor flaws or increase the tension to hold the phone.

Magnets are a possible improvement that can also be retrofitted: Some phones have magnetic areas that are intended for accessories. And small magnets can be found in some packs of rotary paper, for example. This would make it easier to keep the lid closed...
