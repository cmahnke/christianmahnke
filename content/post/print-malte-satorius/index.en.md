Random find: Christmas card from [Malte Satorius](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malte_Sartorius) (1933-2017).

Sometimes you're lucky for misfortune: a few months ago, a stack of books tipped over and smashed the glass of the frame in which the graphic below was.

{{< iiif/iiif src="front/info.json" share=false >}}

Now I took the trouble to remove the glass and was amazed at how professionally this otherwise relatively inconspicuous graphic was framed. As the broken glass was attached to the passe-partout, I had to frame it out completely and discovered a reference to the artist and purpose on the back:

The graphic probably dates from 1964, depicting lamps, and was used as a Christmas card by Malte Satorius and his wife Elisabeth.

My [this year's Christmas cards](http://localhost:1313/post/christmas-2024/) was published earlier this year.
