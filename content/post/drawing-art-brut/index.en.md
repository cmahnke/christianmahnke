I bought an interesting [Art Brut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art) drawing from 1965...

This drawing, somewhat reminiscent of Paul Klee, shows a group riding on a six-legged elephant. There are also a few figures in front of and above it.

Not only the motif is interesting, but also the way it is made: the drawing is done on a primed canvas, on which you can still see the holes for mounting on the frame at the bottom. As there are no distortions, the drawing was probably made directly on the dismantled canvas. It is itself fixed on a sheet that is not quite rectangular, which was then also signed.


So far I have not been able to find out anything about the artist...
