František Gross (1909-1985) was an important Czech painter and graphic artist of the 20th century. He was one of the founding members of the [(artists') group 42](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruppe_42), which was dedicated to various aspects of modern technical civilization. These included urban peripheries, industrial landscapes and machines.

In his work, which was characterized by cubist and surrealist influences, he often used grotesque and absurd motifs in which he mixed machines with human figures. Little is known about Gross outside the Czech Republic, which is also reflected in the lack of German and English Wikipedia entries.

The sheet is dated 1963 and shows a small town or the outskirts of a town at night.
