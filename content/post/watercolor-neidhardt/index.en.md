Paul Neidhardt was a painter from the East Thuringian circle of artists who was born and worked in Gera. In 1933, he undertook a study trip through northern Germany, during which this watercolour was probably created.  
There is an [entry](https://archive.org/details/allgemeineslexik0003hans/page/466/mode/1up) in Hans Vollmer's Allgemeine Lexikon der bildenden KÃ¼nstler.

The colourfulness in particular is a nice addition to my corner of maritime pictures.
