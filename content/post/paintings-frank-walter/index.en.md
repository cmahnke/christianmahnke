The pictures were all signed on 2 February 1991. As he also designed frames, these are certainly also by him, here they are simply two glass plates glued together, with a back panel for hanging.

Frank Walter's full name was Francis Archibald Wentworth Walter, as can be seen from the signature on the back. He lived in [Antigua](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_(Lesser_Antilles)) and was one of the better known artists in the Caribbean.

He only became known in this hemisphere in recent years, and his biography is also interesting: originally an agronomist, he lived in Europe for almost a decade, was politically active after his return in 1961 and then worked as a photographer. Perhaps this is why the pictures above have the character of Polaroid images.
There are also pictures of him in his shop (e.g. here at [ArtForum](https://artguide.artforum.com/artguide/david-zwirner-hong-kong-16041/frank-walter-pastorale-221418)), on the walls of which you can see many pictures in the form above in the Petersburg hanging.

His descendants run a [homepage](https://www.frankwalter.org/), which provides information about research into his work and estate, exhibitions and publications. There is also an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/frankwalterantigua/).
