Klaus Parche was a graphic artist from Leipzig and moved to Mecklemburg-Vorpommern in 1981. Since 2003 he has published political graphics in the magazine [‘Rotfuchs’](https://www.rotfuchs.net/). After his death, the Haffmuseum Ueckermünde dedicated an [exhibition](https://www.ueckermuende.de/portal/seiten/sonderausstellung-im-haffmuseum-900000184-34850.html) to him (runs for a few more days, until Easter 2025).

The title is a wordplay on the German words "Drohung" (Threat) and "Trojanische Pferd" (Trojan horse).

The motif from 2003 refers directly to [UN Resolution 1441](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1441) and the resulting (2nd) [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War). The [oil derricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drilling_rig) on the left emphasise the slogan of the time "No blood for oil".
