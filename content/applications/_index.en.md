{{< bill-nye >}}

[Bill Nye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye) is a well known [science communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_communication) from USA, he got famous in this role during the 90ies.

This role also made him a popular person for illustrating [internet memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme), even if they are not used for science communication.

This example is intended to draw attention to memes as a method of communicating science and culture, the message has certainly got through 😉
